🚀 Data Analysis Internship: Intermediate-Level Tasks Completed 📊
As part of my Data Analysis Internship, I worked on the following tasks:
1️⃣ Regression Analysis:
Split data, fit a linear regression model, and evaluated it using R-squared and MSE.
2️⃣ Time Series Analysis:
Analyzed time-series data, decomposed it into trend, seasonality, and residuals, and applied moving average smoothing.
3️⃣ Clustering Analysis (K-Means):
Standardized data, applied K-means clustering, and visualized clusters in a 2D scatter plot using the elbow method.
🛠 Tools Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn
💡 Key Learnings: Data cleaning, regression, time-series analysis, and clustering.
